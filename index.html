<i> Meri Jaan, </i>
</h2>

<p>
So now that you have read your first letter, I suppose all expectations regarding the next ones have gone down the gutter. I apologize for that, I told you I am really not good at this. This is the second one I am writing for you and I hope you are able to feel good as you read the entirety of this piece.

Have you noticed the title of this letter is hugsandsmiles? I know you remember that I had once written a poem for you, with the same title. I wanted to re-use this title and talk about your hugs and your smiles. Nuzhat Khan, you have one the most beautiful smiles I have ever seen. Whenever you have smiled, my heart has sank itself a little deeper into this ocean of love that I have for you. Whenever you have smiled, my soul has felt a little lighter. Whenever you have smiled, my happiness has increased ten folds. I hope you know that you smile means the world to me. Your smile was one of the things that took my heart when I had seen you the first day. I still remember when I had seen you smile, for the first time, the mere-stance of me happening upon your smiling face was an accident but oh dear God what a beautiful accident it was. I saw you smiling and I told myself right there and then that, "Wow Yusuf, she is so gorgeously beautiful." You had stolen my heart with your smile. You steal my heart every time you smile. Your smile means the world to me. Your smile means the first breath I take every morning after I wake up. Your smile means the last breath I take every night (or morning) when I fall asleep. Your smile means a lot to me. I can never do enough justice to your smile by trying to describe it in words. It is other wordly. And not just your smile, your laughter too. I absolutely melt when I see you laughing. Your laughter is so beautiful and so so so amazing. It is like honey falling on my ears when you laugh and that sweet melody of your laughter takes me to this other place where time is frozen and everything ceases to exist besides you and your laughter and I just witness you laughing, over and over, in a loop and I feel like I can spend all of my eternity in that one moment. Don't you ever stop smiling, my love. Don't you ever stop laughing, meri jaan. Don't, ever.

Let us move on to the other part of this letter, shall we? Your hugs. ðŸ™‚ Boy oh boy, that first hug you gave me, I had no regrets left in my life. If I had taken my last breath in your arms, my life would've been worth it. My whole life would've amounted to everything in this world if I were to take my last breath in your arms. Your hugs are so comforting. They make me feel so safe and secure. I cannot and wouldn't ever want to hug another person. Your hugs are THE hugs for me. Your hugs are my life's source. I am alive just because of your hugs. You put all my broken pieces together with just a hug. You put light into my otherwise dark heart with just one hug of yours. Your hugs are, just like your smiles, otherworldly. Every single time when you have wrapped your arms around me, I have felt like my whole world has become a little quieter and a little more peaceful. You make the voices within me calm down and relax when you hug me. You make the chaos within me settle down with your hugs. I cannot ever thank you enough for choosing to hug me. I cannot ever thank you enough for that. Also, we need to get more pictures of us hugging because that particular moment when I am hugging you is everything to me. If I were to lose my memory tomorrow and would only get to have one memory that I can keep, I would choose it to be our hugs. Your hugs are important and necessary for my life and for my existence. Thank you, Nuzhat Khan, for hugging me and for smiling. Always keep smiling and keep laughing and keep showering me with your hugs, I am blessed. I am yours. You are mine. Thank you.

Yours lovingly,

Yusuf
